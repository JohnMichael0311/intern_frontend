### 1. Install Dependencies

To install the project dependencies while bypassing peer dependency conflicts, run:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This ensures all required packages are installed even if there are version mismatches in peer dependencies.

### 2. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
